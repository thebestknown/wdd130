        <p>Hi, I'm new at this world of programing but I'm very happy I'm learninng new things, I'm excited about this new era at the university and the opportunity I've had that is is online. I like to draw, listen to music and make up products. I am the middle sister, currently my older brother is serving a mission in Argentina Buenos Aires West and I feel very happy and blessed for that, my dream with this career is that I can create modern web pages and call the attention of the market with innovation and even most likely AI, as it is a very powerful tool today. I believe that the future lies in the combination of creativity and technology, and I want to be part of that change. I am also motivated by the thought that, with the right knowledge, I will be able to create products that solve real problems and make a difference. My vision is to deliver projects that are not only functional, but also aesthetically appealing and technologically advanced. Beyond the technical, what really drives me is the ability to connect with people through what I create. I love the idea that my work, whether it's a design or a product, can influence how someone feels or interacts with the digital world. I want to be a voice in a field where innovation and technology continue to expand. I dream of creating digital spaces that are not only useful, but also convey a sense of belonging, something that reflects my own desire to build and contribute something meaningful.</p>
